## Abstract
I am currently a senior graduating in June with a B.S. in Statistical Science, and will be attending the Bren school at UCSB on an Eco-Entrepreneurship fellowship to pursue a Masters in Environmental Science. I hope to use my data science skills to make the world a better place (just like most of you probably) specifically with regards to sustainability. I also have an interest in health and well-being (including happiness and stress management) and you are welcome to come and talk to me if you have any questions or need advice!

I have pursued a few projects in my data career, including using potentialevapotranspiration rate to predict poor harvests in Africa for USAID (see www.fews.net if you're interested), which I will try to get on inertia7 this quarter. I have also started a portfolio which I have been working on in Vincent La's project group last quarter.

I hope to learn more machine learning in python, I REALLY want to learn neural networks and using it to recognize creativity in machine learning! Just like in this video here -> (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSUOdu_5MPc)

I am also interested in working with spatial data, so if you know arcGIS please hit me up. I have been wanting to do something with this website here -> (http://geohub.lacity.org)
